        <div class="about">
        <p>Hello, my name is Reggie Golden. I am a 19-year-old who loves to play video games and spend time with friends. I like to dabble in the amazing world of programming and I am currently taking a class at Epicodus to learn even more about said world. You'll most likely find me playing on PlayStation or certain games on Steam for PC. Thanks for taking the time to learn a little about me.</p>

        <h1>Background about me</h1>
        
        <div class="background">
        <p>Currently, my highest education level is a <strong>High School diploma</strong>. I plan to join a college later in the future; as of right now, there is no set time or date for that, however. I have some experience working in the automobile business, working with my family on vehicle repair projects. We look at auctions to determine which vehicles we'll watch or purchase for a dealership we work with. Afterwards, once we have the vehicle, we get to work on repairing any small things we can do ourselves, such as replacing the reinforcement beam or replacing the air bag(s) if necessary. Then, we take the vehicle to one of the auto mechanics we know to perform the more difficult repairs it may need. Once the vehicle has been repaired to a proper working condition, we sell the vehicle to one of the dealerships we work with and the cycle repeats again.</p>
