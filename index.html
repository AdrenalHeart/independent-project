        <div class="about">
        <p>Hello, my name is Reggie Golden. I am a 19-year-old who loves to play video games and spend time with friends. I like to dabble in the amazing world of programming and I am currently taking a class at Epicodus to learn even more about said world. You'll most likely find me playing on PlayStation or certain games on Steam for PC. Thanks for taking the time to learn a little about me.</p>

        <h1>Background Info</h1>
        
        <div class="background">
        <p>Currently, my highest education level is a <strong>High School diploma</strong>. I plan to join a college later in the future; as of right now, there is no set time or date for that, however. I have some experience working in the automobile business, working with my family on vehicle repair projects. We look at auctions to determine which vehicles we'll watch or purchase for a dealership we work with. Afterwards, once we have the vehicle, we get to work on repairing any small things we can do ourselves, such as replacing the reinforcement beam or replacing the air bag(s) if necessary. Then, we take the vehicle to one of the auto mechanics we know to perform the more difficult repairs it may need. Once the vehicle has been repaired to a proper working condition, we sell the vehicle to one of the dealerships we work with and the cycle repeats again.</p>

        <h1>More About Me</h1>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I don't have very many hobbies, but I do enjoy working in the car business with my family, helping my dad with his medical business, playing video games, spending time with my friends, and learning to program. I generally spend most of the day on my PlayStation, spending time and playing games with some of my friends I have. When I'm not playing games with my virtual friends, I'll spend time with the irl friends I have in my neighborhood. We'll play board games, do some magic tricks, chat about what's going on in our lives, play some video games, or go outside to the nearby park and play some football. In case you haven't already noticed, I pretty much spend most of my time hanging out with a group of people rather than play alone. Although there are definitely times I spend alone, I 100% prefer to use that time with other people who share the same interests as me.</p>
        
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>My interests include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Video games: Dead By Daylight, Dying Light, and Apex Legends</li>
                <li>Watching youtube content creators: Markiplier, No0b3, Monto, and Puppers</li>
                <li>Learning new skills once in a while like programming
                <li>Playing and practicing sports: Football and Basketball
                <li>Helping my dad with his medical business
                <li>Partaking in the family car business</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>As for skills in these departments, I'd say I'm pretty much an expert at video games and can pick up on new things within a short period of time. It doesn't take much time for me to learn about the subject I'm reading on or practicing in, plus I can generally perform what I've just learned decently well.</p>
