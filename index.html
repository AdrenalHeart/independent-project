    <h2>Background Info</h2>
  
    <div class="background">
      <p>Currently, my highest education level is a <strong>High School diploma</strong>. I plan to join a college later in the future; as of right now, there is no set time or date for that, however. I have some experience working in the automobile business, working with my family on vehicle repair projects. We look at auctions to determine which vehicles we'll watch or purchase for a dealership we work with. Afterwards, once we have the vehicle, we get to work on repairing any small things we can do ourselves, such as replacing the reinforcement beam or replacing the air bag(s) if necessary. Then, we take the vehicle to one of the auto mechanics we know to perform the more difficult repairs it may need. Once the vehicle has been repaired to a proper working condition, we sell the vehicle to one of the dealerships we work with and the cycle repeats again.</p>

      <p>I'd say my only skill is that I can pick up on new things within a short period of time. It doesn't take much time for me to learn about the subject I'm reading on or practicing in, plus I can generally perform what I've just learned decently well.</p>
